#### READ-PLEASE

When you first download these files open ``main.js`` and go to line 15/16! Edit this ``   win.loadURL('http://localhost:8080/')`` and change ```('')``` to your URL/File location!

Ex.  `win.loadURL('http://localhost:8080/')` or  `win.loadFILE('c:\users\example\Desktop\master\')`

Too load a URL use ``win.loadURL`` 
Too load a FILE use ``win.loadFILE``
